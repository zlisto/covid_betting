# COVID-19 Betting

This repository contains data for the paper "The Impact of COVID-19 on Sports Betting Markets" by Khizar Qureshi and Tauhid Zaman (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07581).  This paper showed that NBA moneyline betting markets became very inefficient during COVID-19.  By betting on underdogs in the NBA during this period would have provided a substantial positive return.  The data includes moneyline bets for the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, NCAAF, and NCAAB from 2007 to 2010.  Also included is a Colab notebook to analyze the data.
